**Ð½ÐµÑ‡Ñ‘Ñ‚ÐºÐ¸Ðµ Ð¿Ñ€Ð¸ÐºÐ¾Ð»Ñ‹ (name subject to change)** - Telegram-bot made for fun; originally just a text-generator.

### Capabilities:
- Random text generation
- Memes and demotivators ðŸ“¸/ðŸŽ¬
- Simple video and audio editing ðŸŽ¬/ðŸŽ§
- Converting images to stickers ðŸ“¸ --> ðŸŽŸ
- Converting videos to animations and videonotes
- Searching for memes on **[Reddit]**
- Downloading music from YouTube (in the best way ever ðŸ˜Ž)

Bot can be used in **group chats** as well as in **DMs**. Text generation algorithm is based on a slightly enchanced [Markov chain]. **Text generation pack** for a **specific chat** can be increased by sending messages and fusing it with other chats' packs, with reddit comments, and with [exported chat history]. Frequency of text generation can be changed.

### Initial setup
- Have **ffmpeg binaries** and **yt-dlp.exe** locations added to **Path**.
- Create in the working directory **config.txt** file (see example).
- Create in the working directory **_Telegram-Arts\ASCII_** folder and drop there some _ASCII-arts.txt_.
- Create in the working directory **_Telegram-Water_** folder and drop there at least one watermark for demotivators - a **.png** file with a name of two numbers - X and Y of top-left corner for placing the watermark onto the demotivator. Any extra words can be placed in the middle, e.g: **586 700.png**, **586 x 700.png**. For no watermarks simply put there 1x1px black square named **0 0.png**.
- Create in the working directory **_Emoji_** folder and drop there all existing emoji (or just the most used ones). They should be transparent **.png** files named as their UTF-8 code points - e.g. ðŸ˜³ will be **1f633.png**.
- Create in the working directory **BT.json** file with a data for "Ð±ÑƒÐ³ÑƒÑ€Ñ‚-Ñ‚Ñ€ÐµÐ´" generation, e.g:

`{ "_start": { "_start": 1.0 }, "_mid": { "_end": 1.0, "_start": 3.0 } }`

### Main console commands
- **s** - saves all data and shuts bot down
- **/** - lists all console commands
- **/sp** - send the message from **spam.txt** file to all chats
